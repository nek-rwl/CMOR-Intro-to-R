# CMOR-Intro-to-R
Introduction to R mini-course for the CMOR research students group

This course follows, for the most part, the Data Carpentry course R for Social Scientists (https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/)

This repo will contain the worked examples, data, etc. as we go.

Further notes, links, etc are provided at https://pad.carpentries.org/CMOR_Intro_to_R

## Schedule

* Lesson 1: Introduction to R

  What is R? Why should you learn it?
  
  What is reproducible research? Why is it important? How can R help?
  
  We will work through (parts of):
  
  - Introduction to RStudio (https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/00-intro/index.html)
  
  - Introduction to R (https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/01-intro-to-r/index.html)
  
  [Browse the repo at this point](https://github.com/nek-rwl/CMOR-Intro-to-R/tree/a1ad0436cf1f35b32c5af36952219306140eec6b)

* Lesson 2: Data manipulation

  How is data stored in R?
  
  How can we manipulate our data to select subsets of observation or variables, or create new variables?
  
  - Starting with Data (https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/02-starting-with-data/index.html) - just the introduction up to 'What are data frames?'
  - Introducing dplyr for data manipulation (https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/03-dplyr-tidyr/index.html)

* Lesson 3: Continuing with data manipulation

  How can we summarise our data? How can we obtain summary information about different groups of observations in our data?
  
  How can we reshape our data for different analyses?
  
  - Continuing with dplyr and tidyr for data manipulation (https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/03-dplyr-tidyr/index.html)
